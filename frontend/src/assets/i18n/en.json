    "title-first-problem": "Problem #1: Lack of practice",
    "paragraph-one-first-problem": "According to neuroscience research, the essential thing in learning is practice. The more we practice, the more effectively our brain stores learned information for later access. However, traditional learning is the opposite of practice.",
    "paragraph-two-first-problem": "How many times have you opened a code editor and started coding after watching another coding tutorial? Probably not enough. But the problem is not with you. It's the way you learn.",
    "paragraph-three-first-problem": "Encoded videos are designed to be consumed like TV shows. As a result, all the hours spent \"learning\" turn into hours spent \"observing the theory\". And only theory without practice leads to unproductive learning. Especially when learning to code.",
    "title-second-problem": "Problem #2: Low engagement",
    "paragraph-one-second-problem": "According to neuroscience research, we need to ensure that learning is engaging and taps into the emotional side of the brain, through humor, storytelling and games. Emphasis on the rational and logical alone does not produce strong memories.",
    "paragraph-two-second-problem": "And do you remember the last time you watched a coding tutorial or read an article that wasn't boring? Hard to remember at once, right? That's because most educational content is boring.",
    "paragraph-three-second-problem": "Boredom leads to lack of focus and procrastination, which prevents you from staying engaged and remembering everything you've learned.",

    "paragraph-one-mission": "Hello, my name is Jackson. I am the founder of Angular Fantasy. I have been programming for over 7 years and have learned to code using traditional methods.",
    "paragraph-two-mission": "I remember those days. How many times have I forced myself to sit down and learn to program. How boring articles and documentation seemed to me. How much practice I lacked and because of that knowledge quickly disappeared. Learning shouldn't be like this, so I decided to change.",
    "paragraph-three-mission": "I started with the fundamentals and studied how our brains learn. Neuroscience says that effective learning requires (1) a lot of practice and (2) a sense that learning is engaging. Exactly what is often overlooked in traditional ways of learning. Exactly why I had difficulty learning to program. And exactly what needed to be changed.",
    "paragraph-four-mission": "I created Angular Fantasy as a new and more efficient way to learn code. Games are one of the best combinations of (1) practice and (2) an engaging learning environment. They are the next logical step from traditional education. They are the future of learning. And my mission and mission of Angular Fantasy is to make that future our reality.",
